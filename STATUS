Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1875937
   Fix test case against OpenSSL 1.1.1e+.

   Justification:
     Serf should test cleanly against upstreams.

 * r1775239-1781240
   Fix build with current LibreSSL and OpenSSL versions.
   Justification:
     Serf should compile out of the box.
   Branch: ^/serf/branches/1.3.x-sslbuild

     -0: kotkov (
         - A later change, r1833227, seems to further extend CheckFunc() calls,
           so maybe this nomination in its current state won't work in some
           cases on Windows
         - A signficant change of the build approach, maybe not worth it at
           this point for the 1.3.x branch
         - Seems to only be required for LibreSSL, not OpenSSL)

 * r1909252, r1909385, r1909406, r1909413, r1909433
   Do not use OpenSSL functions that operate with FILE to avoid potential CRT
   versions mismatch. Use BIO based functions instead.
   Justification:
     Avoids a potential source of CRT versions mismatch. Removes a dependency
     on openssl/applink.c.
